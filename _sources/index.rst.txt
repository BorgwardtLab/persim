Welcome to Persim's documentation!
==================================




Persim is a Python implementation of Persistence Images as first introduced in `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06217>`_.

It is designed to interface with `Ripser <https://github.com/sauln/ripser>`_, though any persistence diagram should work fine.



Setup
--------

Currently, the only option is to install the library from source:

.. code::

    pip install persim



Usage
-------



First, construct a diagram. In this example, we will use `Ripser <https://github.com/sauln/ripser>`_.

.. code::

    import numpy as np
    from ripser import Rips

    data = np.random.random((100,2))
    rips = Rips()
    dgm = rips.fit_transform(data)
    diagram = dgm[1] # Just diagram for H1


Then from this diagram, we construct the persistence image

.. code::

    from persim import PersImage

    pim = PersImage(diagram)
    img = pim.transform()
    pim.show(img)


Inspiration
-------------

Persistence Images were first introduced in `Adams et al, 2017 <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-337/16-337.pdf>`_. Much of this work, an examples contained herein are inspired by the work of `Obayashi and Hiraoka, 2017 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10082>`_. Choices of weightings and general methods are often derived from `Kusano, Fukumizu, and Yasuaki Hiraoka, 2016 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01741>`_.
